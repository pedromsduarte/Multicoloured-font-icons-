				<p>When the stops have the hability to change our way of thinking, it's good and necessary to keep on the good work. And this stupid idea got life when my collegue and JS guru Marco Dias Lopes was telling me that he just read an article about something and the guy used CSS3 font@face for the icons.</p>
				<p>The idea comes all over my head, thinking that the SUPER-NINJA technic was using multi-colored icons with CSS3 font@face. That's stupid I know, but it gaves me a good hour (maybe two hours) of joy.</p>
